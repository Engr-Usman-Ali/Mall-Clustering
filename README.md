# Mall Customers Clustering â€” KMeans (Unsupervised Learning)
This project applies K-Means clustering to the Mall Customers Dataset to segment customers into distinct groups based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. Itâ€™s part of a data science internship task focused on unsupervised learning techniques.

# Objective
To group customers into meaningful clusters using K-Means Clustering and visualize these segments for business insights.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset
Filename: Mall_Customers.csv

# ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
# Elbow Method â€” Optimal Number of Clusters (k)
The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) is plotted against various values of k to identify the "elbow point" â€” the value after which WCSS decreases more slowly.

**ðŸ“Š Result:**
The elbow clearly appeared at k = 5 clusters.

# Cluster Visualization (Scatter Plot)
Once the clusters were formed using k=5, a scatter plot was generated using the two selected features. Customers are colored according to their assigned cluster, providing a clear visual separation between groups.

# ðŸ“Š Results & Interpretation
Each cluster represents a customer segment:
+ Cluster 0: Moderate Income â€” Low Spending
+ Cluster 1: High Income â€” High Spending
+ Cluster 2: Low Income â€” Low Spending
+ Cluster 3: Moderate Income â€” High Spending
+ Cluster 4: High Income â€” Low Spending

These segments help businesses target customers with personalized offers and marketing strategies.


# What to Focus On
**How the number of clusters was chosen:**
The Elbow Method was applied by plotting the WCSS for cluster counts ranging from 1 to 10. The point where the curve starts to flatten (the "elbow") indicates an appropriate number of clusters â€” in this case, 5.

**Clear visualization of the clusters:**
The scatter plot uses different colors for each cluster, showing how customers are grouped based on Annual Income and Spending Score.
